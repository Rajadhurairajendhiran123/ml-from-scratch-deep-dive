# 🤖 ML From Scratch - Deep Understanding 🚀

Welcome to **ML From Scratch - Deep Dive**, a repository dedicated to learning and implementing machine learning algorithms **from the ground up**. No libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow—just pure Python, NumPy, and mathematical intuition.

---

## 📌 Motivation

This project is designed to:

- Understand ML algorithms at the core level (mathematics + code).
- Build algorithms manually instead of using built-in functions.
- Strengthen problem-solving, debugging, and research skills.
- Create a solid base for advanced topics like Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
