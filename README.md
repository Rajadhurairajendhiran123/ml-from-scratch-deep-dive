# ML From Scratch - Deep Dive 🚀

This repository contains machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to learn how these models work at the lowest level and build a strong foundation in ML theory and practice.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] KNN
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] PCA
- [ ] Neural Networks

## 📁 Structure

Each algorithm has:
- Implementation in Python
- Code-level explanation in comments
- Jupyter notebooks for examples and visualization

## 🛠 Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📌 Motivation

Understanding ML models from scratch helps:
- Build confidence for interviews and research
- Improve debugging skills
- Understand how frameworks like scikit-learn or TensorFlow work under the hood
